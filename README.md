## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js

Moodchime is a site built on bootstrap and running on Node.js. Putting everything together also introduced me to ejs templating which I had to get a little comfortable with to get some of the personalization features working just the way I wanted. Boostrap is your my new friend and I like it very much, The responsiveness of the site was an automatic step in the process and saved me many hours of head scratching.
